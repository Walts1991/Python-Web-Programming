#light version of SQL database
#Includes main functions of SQL database e.g. insert, delete etc.
#SQL database is a collection of tables
#Tables contain columns / rows
#Columns contain data types
#Rows contain data records
#Databases are designed to be used / accessed in small chunks by a machine
#Files optimised to be used and viewed all at once by a user
#Columns must be defined in advanced including data types
#Can have problems if changing a table later on
#50+ data types in SQL
#SQLite has fewer options
#Can also have a local MySQL database but can be a pain to set up
