#DRY - Don't repeat yourself (or others)
#Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported into other programs e.g. common functions
#Vast majority open source - licensed under unrestrictive license GPL / MIT
#Good to understand licensing that modules use
#Major modules should be able to be installed with pip
#pip comes with python as default
#Open command prompt / shell / terminal
#pip install module - This is the syntax to install pip modules
#e.g. flask,math,numpy,statistics
#pip is a program which should be in path
#Windows > Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables > Edit path to contain pip 
#e.g. C:\Python312
#Can download whl files and install using pip install directory
